                    <p class="explanation">
                        <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>I had so many
                        things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it
                        because there was too much.
                    </p>

                    <p class="explanation">
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
                        want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                    </p>

                    <p class="heading-par">How I turned things around</p>

                    <p class="explanation">
                        <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. </strong>I literally put
                        90% of my possessions in the
                        garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    </p>

                    <p class="explanation">
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else
                        to do. And it worked.
                    </p>

                    <p class="heading-par">Now I live the simple life</p>

                    <p class="explanation">
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                        I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <p class="explanation">
                        With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing
                            how I
                            did it</strong>, and how
                        others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
